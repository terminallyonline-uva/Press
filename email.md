“And if you gaze for long into the algorithm, the algorithm gazes also into you.”

Terminally Online, Dr. Idil Galip (UvA Media Studies), and Dr. Daniël de Zeeuw (UvA Media Studies) are hosting an event on the topic of VIBES, sponsored by ASCA and RMES. 

Vibes are everywhere on social media; together with “moods” and “energies”, vibes offer a new way of navigating platforms based on personalized-yet-shared ‘aesthetic feelings’ meticulously curated for affective stickiness by machine learning algorithms whose vectors are equally intangible-yet-catchy. We have arguably entered the age of mood-regulating media. As such vibes speak to the “affective” and “sonic” turns in media and cultural studies that offer new conceptual and methodological inroads to the non-conscious and non-representational dimensions of online sociality, culture and politics. During this symposium we will explore these connections and how as researchers we can vibe-with new ambient media forms like ASMR, Femcel Pinterest moodboards, and Spotify mood playlists. This is the second symposium organized by the Terminally Online initiative with (r)MA students from media studies.
